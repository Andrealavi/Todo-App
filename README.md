# Todo App

This is a project I made on my fourth high school year in order to put in practice all the things I've learned about web development.

Technologies used:
- NodeJS
- Express npm module for managing the server
- Handlebars for creating dynamic web pages
- SQL for managing the database
- Docker for hosting a mySQL image
